# Shepherding With NAO and BOLT
A demonstration of Strombom shepherding using Softbank's NAO and Sphero Edu's BOLTs. The demonstration is completed in a Vicon motion capture environment.

This repository is designed to allow exploration of complex Shepherding algorithms and humanoid robot motion controllers through the use of accessible learning robots, being the NAO and Sphero BOLT.
